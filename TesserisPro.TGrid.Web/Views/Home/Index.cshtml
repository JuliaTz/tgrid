                                Out-of-the-box, Kendo UI Web is ready for touch. All Kendo UI Web widgets provide full support for
                                touchscreen devices, such as the iPad, iPhone, and
                                Android, so that your web apps can be used on a wide array of devices with varying input options. Even Kendo UI’s drag and drop framework is touch-enabled,
                                eliminating the need for you to duplicate code just to handle mouse and touchscreen inputs.

                            Every aspect of Kendo UI has been built from the ground-up to deliver maximum JavaScript app performance. Kendo UI is not another jQuery UI clone, and every decision made in Kendo UI optimizes for performance first. From a lightweight, built-in templating library that performs significantly faster than jQuery Templates, to optimized animations that leverage CSS3 hardware acceleration (when available), and advanced UI virtualization, Kendo UI leaves no stone unturned to deliver client-side UI with top performance.
